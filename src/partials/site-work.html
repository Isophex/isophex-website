                                    They came to us in need of a complete redesign of both their website and overall branding.
                                    As a new startup, Helios needed to stand out and convey new ideas to a more conventual audience.
                                    Taking into consideration the fact that it was a business to business (B2B) site, our solution
                                    included a more traditional highly functional design that conveyed a “new brighter way to
                                    manage IP operations."</p>
